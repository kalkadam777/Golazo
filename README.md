# Golazo Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
Golazo is a comprehensive web application designed to manage and track information related to football clubs, players, coaches, user activities, and dynamic content such as articles and comments. This system supports user authentication, session management, and robust role-based access control, ensuring efficient and secure handling of data.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Football Club and Player Management:**
   - Manage detailed data on football players, clubs, and coaches.
   - Track player transfers, performance statistics, and club affiliations.
   
2. **User and Permissions Management:**
   - Provide secure user authentication and role-based access control.
   - Log user actions for transparency and auditing.
   
3. **Content Management:**
   - Allow authorized users to create, edit, and interact with articles and comments.
   
4. **User Personalization:**
   - Enable users to maintain profiles and save favorite clubs and players.

## 3. System Architecture

**Backend Components:**
- **Models:**
  - Define entities such as `User`, `Player`, `Club`, `Article`, `Comment`, `Match`, `Standings`, and `League`.
  
- **Business Logic:**
  - Process requests, enforce permissions, and manage data relationships.
  
- **Database:**
  - Typically uses a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL). Foreign keys establish entity relationships.

**Frontend Components:**
- **Vue.js (Nuxt.js optional):**
  - Build dynamic single-page interfaces and consume the REST API.
  
- **Static Files:**
  - Serve CSS, JS, images, and other static assets for styling and interactivity.

## 4. Technologies Used
- **Backend:**
  - Django (Python), Django Rest Framework (optional for API endpoints).
  
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Vue.js for SPA features (Nuxt.js integration possible)
  
- **Database:**
  - SQLite by default (easily switchable to PostgreSQL or MySQL).
  
- **Version Control:**
  - Git for source control and collaboration.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Django’s built-in logging framework for creating audit trails.

## 5. Installation Steps and Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.x
- (Optional) Node.js for frontend build if using a SPA setup.


## 6. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

**Key Entities:**
- **User:** Linked to `UserProfile`, `Article`, and `Comment`.
- **Player:** Linked to `Club` and possibly `TransferHistory`.
- **Club:** Associated with `Player`, `Coach`, and `League`.
- **Article:** Linked to `User` and `Comment`.
- **Match & Standings:** Linked to `League` and `Club`.

*(An actual ERD diagram can be created using tools like draw.io or ERDPlus and included here as an image.)*

## 7. REST API Documentation (Optional)
The project can provide a RESTful API for external integrations:

**Example Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/players/`: Retrieve a list of all players.
- `POST /api/players/`: Add a new player (admin-only).
- `GET /api/clubs/<id>/`: Get details of a specific club.
- `POST /api/articles/`: Create a new article (requires authentication and appropriate role).
- `GET /api/me/`: Get the current authenticated user’s details.
- `GET/PUT/PATCH /api/me/profile/`: Retrieve or update the currently authenticated user’s profile.

**Authentication:**
- Uses JWT tokens for protected endpoints.
- Obtain tokens via `POST /api/token/` with a valid username/password.

## 8. User Roles and Permissions
**User Roles:**
- **Superuser:** Full control over the entire system.
- **Article Writer (Journalist):** Can create and manage articles.
- **League Admin:** Can manage league data, matches, and standings.
- **Regular User:** Can comment, set favorites, and read articles.

**Permission Enforcement:**
- Django’s built-in permissions and groups are used to enforce access control.
- DRF’s permissions ensure secure and role-appropriate access to API endpoints.

## 9. Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Real-time Data Integration:**
   - Connect with live football statistic APIs for immediate updates.

2. **Social Features:**
   - Allow users to follow each other, share content, and establish a community.

3. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Provide data visualization and dashboards for performance trends and historical comparisons.

4. **Mobile Application:**
   - Extend functionality to iOS/Android via a dedicated mobile app or Progressive Web App (PWA).

## 10. Conclusion
Golazo offers a robust and scalable platform for managing a wide range of football-related data. With a strong focus on security, role-based access, and extensibility, it meets the needs of administrators, journalists, and football enthusiasts. Future enhancements can further enrich user engagement, data analysis, and platform capabilities.
